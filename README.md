1. It is making use of 13.7% of the CPU, one of the threads is performing unnecessary operations, consuming resources unnecessarily. 

The consumer process, since it is consulting the size of the queue repeatedly, when it is already known that due to the speed of production of the producing thread, it will be emptied very quickly, causing the waste of resources.

* Although the functionalities for the pause and check options were implemented and the resume is not maintained, it usually occurs in cases where there are many immortals.

* Implementation pause, resume and stop:
